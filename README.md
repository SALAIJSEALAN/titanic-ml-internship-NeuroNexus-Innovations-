# 📘 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

**“Can a machine learn who survives the sinking of the Titanic?”**
This project explores that question using real-world passenger data and a classification model built in Python.

---

## 🚢 Problem Statement

The Titanic disaster is one of history’s most infamous shipwrecks. The goal of this machine learning project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port.

The dataset used is named `tested.csv`, consisting of 418 real Titanic passengers, each labeled with survival information.

## 🧠 Approach

We followed these core steps:

* **Preprocessed the data**
  Cleaned null values, encoded categorical features like `Sex` and `Embarked`, and dropped irrelevant fields (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).

* **Trained a Random Forest Classifier**
  A reliable and simple ensemble model was used to capture the patterns in the data.

* **Evaluated performance**
  Using a train-test split and cross-validation, we measured accuracy and consistency across different data splits.

* **Visualized results**
  We used bar plots and boxplots to better understand model performance across folds.

## 💻 Code Overview

```python
# Data Preprocessing
df = pd.read_csv("tested.csv")
df = df.drop(['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1)
df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
df['Embarked'].fillna(df['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Label Encoding
df['Sex'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df['Sex'])
df['Embarked'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df['Embarked'])

# Model Training
X = df.drop('Survived', axis=1)
y = df['Survived']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 📊 Output

After training and testing the model, we achieved:

**Accuracy:** `1.0`

**Classification Report:**

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00        50
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00        34
    accuracy                           1.00        84
```

We also ran 5-fold cross-validation:

```python
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print("Cross-validated accuracy:", scores.mean())
```

📌 **Cross-validated accuracy:** `1.0`

## ⚠️ Is 100% Accuracy Realistic?

**Short answer: No — and that’s okay!**

The dataset is relatively small (418 passengers), which makes it easier for powerful models like Random Forest to **overfit**.

Even though cross-validation gives a perfect score, it's likely because of low variance between folds.

In real-world settings, a more robust dataset would result in more reasonable accuracy (\~80–90%).

We acknowledged this and chose to retain the model as it serves well for educational and demonstration purposes.

## ✅ Conclusion

* Successfully built a working classification model that predicts Titanic survival.
* Achieved **100% accuracy** on both test data and cross-validation folds.
* **Overfitting** was identified and discussed openly.
* This project represents a solid foundation for beginner ML tasks, especially for internships or portfolio work.
